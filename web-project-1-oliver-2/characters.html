        <h4>Brief Biography</h4>
        <p>
          I am just a fat, unintelligent guy who works in a nuclear power plant
          eating donuts all day. What do you expect? I am just a dad of 3
          children, those being Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Bart is well,
          interesting to say the least, hes somewhat of a troublemaker and often
          get mad at him for his actions. I also having my loving wife, Marge,
          who supports me through all my struggles and makes me feel better
          about myself. Below is a video of the certain times where I actually
          was intelligent:

          In conclusion, I am just a fat dad with a crayon in his brain doing
          dumb actions. Here is a table of my favourite things in different
          categories:

        <h4>Brief Biography</h4>
        <p>
          I am just a hard working mom that stays at home, I support Homer
          through his struggles, but more often or not, I may get frustrated
          about a certain situation and get mad, I have two sisters who are
          well, not aren't really like me. I also forgot to mention I have tall
          hair which is obvious if you look at me for a second. My job is just
          to take care of the children in the house and thats all I do. I have
          had my own adventures such as being in plays, but not much besides
          that. I also have a car which is one of the two vehicles our family
          has. This concludes a brief introduction about me as a mother of 3
          children.

        <h4>Brief Biography</h4>
        <p>
          I am just a kid who always finds a way to prank anybody, I know I get
          detention, but I don't care, I still do it anyway, my hobbies are
          skateboarding, pranking people, and thats about it. I once worked for
          the mafia in Springfield doing various tasks such as being a
          bartender. They say I have a future of trouble, but I will just see
          how my life rolls out, who knows? Maybe I could be a taste tester in
          the future! I would like to conclude this by saying two words,
          <b>ay caramba!</b> Below is a picture of me on my skateboard:

        <h4>Brief Biography</h4>
        <p>
          I am just the smart one in the family, I have a passion of playing the
          saxophone. I am just a nerdy person always striving for perfect grades
          at school. A simple person with simple passions, hobbies, and life.
          Well, that concludes my brief biography and I'll be going to my room
          now.
